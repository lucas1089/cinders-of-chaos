# Chaos server scripts (TFS 1.4.2, Hellgrave Exodus v3.7.5 style)

Server side for the client modules in `client/overlay/modules/`. One revscript per module,
each registering a `login` CreatureEvent plus an `extendedopcode` CreatureEvent (same pattern as
`scripts/customs/stats_inspect/inspect.lua` in Exodus).

**Nothing here has been run on a TFS server.** There was no TFS, no MySQL and no OTClient in the
build environment. What was done: every file passes `luac5.3 -p`, and the Lua logic of all modules
was exercised against a hand-written mock of the TFS API (fake `Player`, `db`, `Game`, the
reference server's own `json.lua`) in a scratch directory that is not part of this tree. That
checks protocol shapes and branching, not engine behaviour. `sql/chaos.sql` was not run against a
database. Treat every engine-API call (listed under "Assumed API") as unverified.

## Layout

  sql/chaos.sql                       CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS for 8 tables
  tools/gen_passivetree_data.lua      regenerates passivetree_data.lua from the client tree
  data/scripts/chaos/
    chaos_constants.lua               ALL opcodes, storage keys, table names, tunables, shared helpers
    bank.lua  autoloot.lua  daily.lua  notifications.lua  passivetree.lua  passivetree_data.lua
    dungeons.lua  infinitytower.lua  stash.lua
```

## Install

1. Copy `server/data/scripts/chaos/` to `<server>/data/scripts/chaos/`.
2. Run `server/sql/chaos.sql` against the game database (`mysql -u USER -p DB < chaos.sql`).
   Foreign keys assume `players.id` is `int(11) NOT NULL` (stock TFS schema).
3. Restart the server (or `/reload scripts`). Check the console for Lua errors.
4. Autoloot only: if `data/talkactions/talkactions.xml` registers `!autoloot` (the legacy
   `talkactions/scripts/autoloot.lua`), TFS 1.4.2 keeps the XML one and silently ignores
   `autoloot.lua`'s `!autoloot`. Remove that XML line for live window refresh. See "Stubbed or assumed".
5. Client: apply the client-side gaps listed below, otherwise bank, autoloot, daily and stash
   cannot talk to the server at all.

`data/scripts/chaos/admin/` and `sql/chaos_admin.sql` are a separate admin-panel module written by another
task; they are not covered here. They use extended opcode 120, which does not collide with any opcode below.

Every script starts with `if not Chaos then dofile("data/scripts/chaos/chaos_constants.lua") end`,
so load order inside `data/scripts` does not matter (the `dofile` path is relative to the server's
working directory, as with the rest of the Exodus libs).

## Module status

| Module | File | Opcode(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| game_bank | `bank.lua` | 60 | Gold deposit/withdraw/transfer on the native bank balance, star currency in `chaos_bank`. `!bank` opens the window. Written to the client contract; mock-tested only. |
| game_autoloot | `autoloot.lua` | 216 | Window protocol and `!autoloot` / `!autolootclient` talkactions; list lives in the same storages (base 80000) as the Exodus onDropLoot callback, which does the actual looting. XML talkaction conflict possible (see below). |
| game_daily | `daily.lua` | 207 | 7-day streak with claim, midnight rollover, `!daily`, optional open on login. Reward items are placeholders (crystal coins). |
| game_notifications | `notifications.lua` | 79 out, 151/152 in | `/gmnotify`, accept/decline of a standard TFS party invite, `ChaosNotify.*` sender API. Catacomb start / leave-queue are hooks only; nothing triggers party/catacomb/task/battle pass toasts automatically. |
| game_passivetree | `passivetree.lua`, `passivetree_data.lua` | 65 | Points, save with full validation (known ids, connected to root, point cap), preset storage, reset for level x 250 gold. Bonuses are computed (`ChaosPassiveTree.getBonuses`) but **not applied to anything**. |
| game_dungeons | `dungeons.lua` | 109 | Reads the Exodus `DUNGEON_SYSTEM` table. Queue, group formation, teleport in, timer, monster-count progress, boss kill, difficulty unlock, speed/flawless challenges, solo/group rankings, teleport out. Difficulty does not change monsters; loot panel is display only. |
| game_infinitytower | `infinitytower.lua` | 214 | Seasons, points, best floor/time, ranking, milestone claim, `!tower`, `/towerrun` staff test helper. **The tower gameplay does not exist**; a future script reports results with `ChaosTower.recordRun`. Season-end top 3 chests not implemented. |
| game_stash | `stash.lua` | **110** (new), `!stash` | Deposit by drag, redeem, categories, block list, `!stash all`, DB persistence. Client must be ported first (see below). |

Extended opcodes 60, 65, 79, 109, 110, 151, 152, 207, 214, 216 are all registered in the global
`ChaosOpcodes` table in `chaos_constants.lua`.

### Opcode collision check
Searched the reference server for every `onExtendedOpcode`, `sendExtendedOpcode(` and opcode
constant. Opcodes in use there: 1, 67, 73, 89, 91, 92, 99, 106, 107, 136, 181, 201, 202. (The
`ServerOpcodes` 125/126 in `global.lua` are game-protocol opcodes, a different number space.)
None of the Chaos opcodes collide; no adjustment was needed. 110 was chosen for the stash because
the client has no fixed value and 110 is free. Storage keys `7100000-7100999` and DB tables
`chaos_*` are new; the one deliberate overlap is autoloot's storage base 80000 (shared on purpose).

## Client-side gaps found while reading the client (not changed, `client/` is out of scope)

1. **`sendAction(opcode, action, data)` does not exist in the overlay.** `game_bank`, `game_autoloot`
   and `game_daily` call a global `sendAction(op, action, data)`; the only `sendAction` in the tree
   is passivetree's own two-argument one. It must send `json.encode({action = action, data = data})`
   on that extended opcode (the server expects exactly that envelope). Without it those three
   modules send nothing.
2. **game_stash** uses Black Talon's `modules.client_manager`, which is not in the overlay. The
   server speaks `{"action":"Stash","data":{"make":...}}` both ways on opcode 110. Minimal port:
   set `Stash.Opcode = 110`, replace `modules.client_manager.Manage.NewModule(...)` with
   `ProtocolGame.registerExtendedOpcode(110, function(_, _, buf) local j = json.decode(buf); if j and j.action == "Stash" then Stash.DataManager(nil, 110, j.data) end end)`
   and drop/replace `modules.game_extramenu`, `Keybind`, `modules.game_windowfocus` if absent.
   The envelope is an **assumption** about what client_manager does; only the client's outbound
   JSON proves it for the client-to-server direction.
3. `game_dungeons` loads banners from `/images/dungeons/<title>`; no such images are in the
   overlay (titles: Bones Dungeon, Master of the Elements, Forbidden Chevalier, Rootkraken).
4. `game_passivetree` sends via `protocolGame.sendExtendedJSONOpcode`, an OTCv8 call. Stock OTClient
   10.98 may lack it.
5. `bank.lua` / daily client code reference undefined variables in error branches (`data`/`msgWindow`);
   harmless unless JSON decoding fails.

## Stubbed or assumed (read this before relying on anything)

General
- Engine API assumed to match TFS 1.4.2: `Player:getBankBalance/setBankBalance/getMoney/addMoney/removeMoney`,
  `Game.getPlayerByGUID`, `Game.getSpectators(pos, multifloor, onlyPlayers, minX, maxX, minY, maxY)`,
  `Tile:getThing(stackpos)`, `Container:getItems(true)`, `Item:remove(count)`, `Item:hasAttribute`,
  `ItemType:isRune/isStackable/isPickupable/getWeaponType/getClientId`, `Party:getInvitees/addMember/removeInvite`,
  `MonsterType:getOutfit`, CreatureEvent types `kill` and `death`, `os.mtime` (falls back to `os.time`),
  `result.getNumber`. None verified against a real server.
- `json` global is the Exodus `lib/core/json.lua` (rxi). Empty tables encode as `[]`.
- Packets stay far below the ~24 KB network message limit (stash is chunked at 40 items).
- All client input is validated (integers, ranges, ownership), but there is no flood control.

bank
- Star item id 35572 is **assumed** to be both the client id the client hard-codes and a valid server
  item id. If `ItemType(35572)` is invalid on your server the star tab is disabled (all zeros).
- Offline transfers update `players.balance` directly; transfers have no fee, limit or log.

autoloot
- Client numeric ids sent via `!autolootclient` are treated as **client** ids and mapped to server ids
  through a one-time scan of item ids 100..100000.
- Looting itself is not done here; it needs the Exodus `scripts/creaturescripts/autoloot.lua` callback.
- If the XML `!autoloot` talkaction exists, add/remove still work (it writes the same storages) but
  the open window does not refresh until reopened.

daily
- Reward table is a placeholder. The shipped client adds 2 to `Day` and maps claims through
  `{6,7,1,2,3,4,5}`; the server compensates (documented in the file). Day 7 of that client logic is
  otherwise unreachable, so do not "simplify" the offset.
- "Midnight" is server local time; the client's countdown uses client local time minus 1 hour.

notifications
- No catacomb system exists in the reference server: `start_catacomb` and `leave_queue` only call the
  overridable `ChaosNotify.onStartCatacomb` / `onLeaveQueue` (the latter also leaves the dungeon queue).
- No `Party:onInvite` hook exists in the reference server, so `partyInvite` toasts are never sent
  automatically (call `ChaosNotify.partyInvite`). Its text says "catacomb"; for plain parties it reads oddly.
- Task / battle pass toasts need one call added to the reference `tasks.lua` / battle pass code.
- `/gmnotify` is allowed for any group with `Group:getAccess()`.

passivetree
- Tree shape comes from the client's `nodes.lua` (618 nodes; the file records 932 stat entries).
  Regenerate `passivetree_data.lua` with `tools/gen_passivetree_data.lua` whenever the client tree changes.
- Points formula is invented: `(level - 8) * 1` plus storage `7100020`. Change `Chaos.passive`.
- Only one preset slot exists in the client UI; presets 0 and 1 are the same slot. `refund` is just a resync.
- Stat keys such as `strength`, `incrementFire`, `absorbIce`, `criticalHitChance`, `lifeLeechChance`
  are **not applied**. Exodus' `CHARSTAT_*` values are stored by its own system and would conflict.
  Use `ChaosPassiveTree.getBonuses(player)` or `ChaosPassiveTree.appliers[statName] = function(player, value)`.
- The client's "exclude" (two big nodes of one path) rule is not enforced: no node in the data uses it.

dungeons
- Entry is by queue, not by the Exodus modal/PZ/party rules: no PZ requirement, no real party needed,
  players are matched individually (same difficulty, group size = `AmountParty` when `NeedParty`, else 1).
- Bosses are assumed to exist inside the dungeon box (map spawns or `SpawnMonsters`). Boss names per
  dungeon id are in `Chaos.dungeons.extra` (guessed from the Exodus boss scripts) and must match the monster
  names on your server. Progress % = monsters that disappeared from the box / monsters at start (summons
  ignored); the boss counts as dead when `onKill` credits it, or when it was seen and is gone.
- One run per dungeon at a time (they share a single map area). All monsters in the box are removed when a
  run ends.
- Difficulty (1..6) is stored and unlocked (finish on your top difficulty to unlock the next) but changes nothing in-game.
- Loot panel and challenge list are configured in `Chaos.dungeons.extra`; real loot comes from the boss XML.
- The Exodus `DUNGEON_SYSTEM` is used for level, group size, positions, time and cooldown. Its modal script reads
  `Storages.TimerCooldown` while the table defines `timerCooldown` (existing bug); this module accepts both.
  `DUNGEON_SYSTEM.Dungeons[3]` has `DungeonPos` z=0 but `FromPos/ToPos` z=7; the box is widened to include
  DungeonPos so players are not treated as "outside".
- Cooldown (`DUNGEON_SYSTEM.CooldownTime`, 1 h) is also applied after a win (`cooldownOnSuccess`) and when a
  member leaves/dies.
- Ranking: solo = best time per player (party size 1), group = best runs with 2+ players. Times in ms.

infinitytower
- No tower gameplay. Milestone item ids are the ids the client displays and are assumed to be valid server ids.
- Season = 30 days counted from 2025-01-01 UTC (`Chaos.tower`). `nextTry` cooldown disabled by default.

stash
- Opcode 110 is chosen here. Remote access is on for everybody by default (`Chaos.stash.remoteForEveryone`);
  otherwise storage `7100010 > 0` grants it. A depot/locker proximity requirement is not implemented.
- Only stackable, pickupable, attribute-free items are accepted; categories are heuristic (rune, ammo,
  potion/valuable by name, other).
- The `tooltip` field is a plain string; the client's `buildTooltip` is an engine extension whose expected
  type was not verified.
- `UpdateList` always echoes a fresh list, even on rejection, because the client depends on it.

## Tunables
Everything adjustable is in `chaos_constants.lua`: rewards, limits, boss names, season length, storages, table names.

## Monster tiers and monster bar

`data/scripts/chaos/monster_tiers.lua` (opcode 125, client `game_monsterbar`): magic, rare and legendary monsters (health, speed, damage and experience multipliers in `ChaosTiers`), a roll on every spawn (`spawnChance`), and an ambush: when a player kills a monster a magic, rare or legendary copy may appear next to the corpse (`ambush`, `ambushTier`, `maxChain`). All numbers are at the top of the file. Not run on a server; it assumes the Exodus `onSpawn` and `onGainExperience` event callbacks, `Creature:setMaxHealth`/`changeSpeed` and `Game.createMonster(name, pos, extended, force)`. Tier state is kept in memory only and is lost on reload. No name prefix is set in the world (there is no `Monster:setName`); the client prefixes the tier on the bar only. Tier and boss multipliers also do not change loot.

### Modifiers and shaders (monster_tiers.lua)
Every magic, rare, legendary and boss monster rolls modifiers: magic 1-2, rare 2-3, legendary 3-4, boss 4-5 (`modCount`). Thirteen modifiers in `ChaosMods`: Blazing, Chilling, Venomous and Shocking (on-hit conditions), Vampiric (heals from damage dealt), Berserker (more damage below half health), Brutal (+40% damage), Stoneskin (-30% damage taken), Reflective (reflects 15%), Regenerating (2% health every 2.5 s), Swift (+40 speed), Explosive (fire blast on death), Juggernaut (+60% health). The monster is drawn with the outfit shader of its strongest modifier, from the 17 shaders already in `data/XML/shaders.xml` (animated, glowing), and a rotating magic effect plays one modifier's icon at a time, so the look follows the modifiers. Only one shader fits one monster, so a monster with five modifiers shows the colour of the strongest one. Bosses get modifiers too (`bossMods`), without stat scaling. The names are listed under the bar. The client must register those shader names (Exodus does it in `game_shaders`; the Astra base needs the same list, see below). Shader ids 5 ("blue Dortmond", name differs from the client's "blue_Dortmond") is not used.
